Get into a comfortable position, with your hands and feet uncrossed. And now, lift your eyes as high as you can, further back as if you're looking through your eyebrows. 

Choose a real or imaginary point above your head and keep your eyes fixed on that point. 
Now, take a deep breath from your abdomen, without holding your breath in your chest... and exhale, let go. Take another deep breath; your eyes are still fixed up high, and exhale, let it go. And now, one last time. 

Take a deep breath, hold for a few seconds, and now, as you exhale slowly, lower your eyelids, but keep looking up, and then close your eyes completely. You immediately begin to feel the muscles and nerves inside and around your eyes loosening. 

Feel your eyelids becoming more and more tired, heavier and heavier, but you can forget about your eyes now, their position; let them go wherever they want. Let your body develop a sensation of floating, like a light undulating movement, let yourself go, let yourself sway, farther and farther you let yourself float. 

Now, imagine in front of you, 10 steps descending. You can truly feel your feet, see your feet... positioning themselves on the tenth step as every muscle and every nerve in your body relaxes, loosens, and you go deeper and deeper.

Now, go down to step 9, see your feet, feel your feet connecting with every step you take, with every word I utter... Descend now to step 8, easily, calmly, gently entering an even deeper level. Descend to step 7, slide down, deeper and deeper, further into a state of hypnosis. Go down to step 6, even lower, deeper... into a profound awareness of yourself.

Now, go down to step 5, you're already halfway there, while easily, calmly, gently entering an even deeper level. Descend to step 4, every muscle, every nerve in your body relaxes, loosens, and relaxes... Descend to step 3, slide down even further, much deeper. 

Descend now to step 2 and go down to a level where these words influence your mind, and then your mind influences these words... and you relax more and more, even more... as you slide even deeper as you slide to step 1 you descend, slide, deeper, you go even further down into a profound awareness of yourself so again, go down, slide down, deeper, and you continue to relax more and more. 

Let your mind drift further and further, float further and further, and listen with your subconscious, as you continue to descend and listen. Now, as you are comfortably relaxed, begin to focus on your breath. Inhale deeply and let the air fill your lungs. 

Exhale slowly, releasing any tension in your body. Start this meditation by finding a comfortable position, sitting or lying down. 
Close your eyes and begin taking deep breaths, allowing your body to relax deeply. Now visualize a vortex of golden energy forming above your head. 

This vortex represents the opportunity, success, money, intelligence, and creativity you wish to attract into your life. Imagine a stream of this golden energy flowing down from the top of your head, like a cascade of light.

This flow is full of endless possibilities and resources. Feel how this golden energy begins to flow down through your head, penetrating every part of your body. With each breath, feel it becoming more powerful and brighter. Now, visualize yourself entering into the flow of this energy. 

Feel how it wraps your body in a sense of warmth and strength. As the flow passes through your head, focus your attention on what you want to attract into your life. See it as part of this golden energy flowing through you, becoming a tangible reality. 

Visualize the success you seek, imagine money coming in, feel your intelligence expanding, and embrace your creativity unlocking. These elements merge with your essence as the flow carries them throughout your body. 

In the flow, every thought of doubt or limitation dissolves. Feel that you are fully aligned with your ability to attract what you desire. Stay immersed in this flow of energy for a while, experiencing the powerful feeling of positive attraction. Feel how this energy is working for you in a positive way, bringing success, money, intelligence, and creativity with it.

Now, gradually let the flow move downward until it reaches your feet. Feel it grounding into the earth, connecting you to the strength of the earth itself. 

Grant yourself with this meditation the awareness that you have the power to attract success, money, intelligence, and creativity into your life. You carry this positive energy with you and the awareness of your unlimited potential. 

Now, as you are in deep connection with this energy, take a moment to reflect on the power of attraction. Remember that what you attract into your life is a direct manifestation of your energies, thoughts, and intentions.

Feel how you are in perfect harmony with the energy of the universe, as this golden energy is a projection of your positive intentions. Visualize your desires now, whether they are related to success, money, intelligence, or creativity. 

Imagine how these desires are drawn to you, like a magnet for the energy you have summoned. Feel how your desires are now an integral part of the energy flow passing through your body. This is your reality, a reality of abundance and manifestation. Now, repeat to yourself: 'Every day, in every way, my mind is becoming stronger and more capable.

 I am open to learning new things. My intelligence grows with every challenge I encounter. My learning potential is limitless. Imagine yourself in a place that represents knowledge and wisdom. It could be a vast library, a peaceful study room, or a stimulating classroom. 

Visualize yourself engaging with complex ideas with ease and enthusiasm. 
See yourself solving problems, mastering new skills, and understanding intricate concepts effortlessly. Now, imagine yourself in a room filled with abundance. Everywhere you look, you see symbols of prosperity and success: piles of golden coins, lucrative business contracts, and endless opportunities. Feel comfortable with this abundance, knowing that you have the ability to attract wealth and success. Repeat to yourself: 'I am a magnet for money and abundance". 

Opportunities to create wealth flow to me easily and naturally. Take a deep breath and visualize a purifying energy flow through your body. This energy brings vitality and rejuvenation with it. Imagine every cell in your body being bathed in this refreshing energy, feeling your body become lighter, stronger, and healthier. 

With each breath, you feel younger, full of energy and vitality. Now, focus on your inner self. Imagine a treasure representing your spiritual wealth. Each gem and coin is an aspect of your spirit: love, gratitude, peace, and wisdom. See this treasure growing as you nourish your spirit with positive thoughts, meditation, and connection with others.

Feel in harmony and at peace, knowing that your true wealth comes from within. Remember that you are the creator of your reality, and the Law of Attraction is working for you at all times. Be grateful for this deep connection and for the power you have to manifest your dreams. 

Now, gradually, begin to bring your attention back, breath in ,1,2,3, breath out and come back.
