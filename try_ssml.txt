    Get into a comfortable position, with your hands and feet uncrossed.<break time="1.5s"/> And now, lift your eyes as high as you can, further back as if you're looking through your eyebrows. <break time="1s"/>
    
    Choose a real or imaginary point above your head and keep your eyes fixed on that point. <break time="1s"/>
    Now, take a deep breath from your abdomen, without holding your breath in your chest.<break time="1.5s"/>.. and exhale, let go. Take another deep breath; your eyes are still fixed up high, and exhale, let it go. And now, one last time 
    
    <break time="1.5s"/>Take a deep breath, hold for a few seconds, and now, as you exhale slowly, lower your eyelids, but keep looking up, and then close your eyes completely. You immediately begin to feel the muscles and nerves inside and around your eyes loosening. <break time="1s"/>
    
    Feel your eyelids becoming more and more tired, heavier and heavier, but you can forget about your eyes now, their position; let them go wherever they want. Let your body develop a sensation of floating, like a light undulating movement, let yourself go, let yourself sway, farther and farther you let yourself float. <break time="1s"/>
    
    Now, imagine in front of you, 10 steps descending. You can truly feel your feet, see your feet<break time="1.5s"/> positioning themselves on the tenth step as every muscle and every nerve in your body relaxes, loosens, and you go deeper and deeper

    <break time="2s"/>Descend now to step 2 and go down to a level where these words influence your mind, and then your mind influences these words...<prosody rate="slow"> and you relax more and more, even more</prosody> as you slide even deeper as you slide to step 1 you descend, slide, deeper, you go even further down into a profound awareness of yourself so again, go down, slide down, deeper, and you continue to relax more and more

    <break time="1s"/>
    <prosody rate="slow">Let your mind drift further and further, float further and further, and listen with your subconscious, as you continue to descend and listen.
